Get top 30 of the teams from a given date::

    from HLTV import Teams
    import datetime
    teams_ago = Teams().GetTopTeams(date=str(datetime.datetime.now()).teams

The above example will exit with an error because the date is today, this will work::

    teams_ago = Teams().GetTopTeams(date="2016-03-21").teams

.. note:: GetTopTeams will not search for the classment close to your date. Be careful that the date is a monday on which a classment came out.

.. note:: GetTopTeams supports the complete format **datetime.datetime** of dates turned into a string. Otherwise **it will wait for a date formated this way: YYYY-MM-DD**

You can now use all of the above at the same time::

    from HLTV import Teams
    top_team = Teams().GetTopTeams("Europe", 1, "2016-03-21")
    print(top_team.teams, top_team.score, top_team.players)
